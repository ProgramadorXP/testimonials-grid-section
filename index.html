                    "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been locking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfuly switched carrers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."
